Setup : 

Go to your directory where you wnat to clone the application, and then use the following commands : 

1. git clone https://github.com/PankajMean/Dealdeck.git

2. npm install

3. bower install

4. node server.js

5. Go to browser and type localhost:3000

My Assignment : 
Using the MEAN stack, create a web page that shuffles a standard deck of 52 cards, and then deals them in a matrix of 13 columns by 4 rows. Calculate the percentage that the deckis in the correct order and store the deck configuration and the percentage in the database. Display an average percentage across all historical percentages. Display the deck on the screen with a button that says "Deal Again" to deal the next deck. All business logic should be handled on the back end with node. Isolate your card generation and shuffling algorithm, as I will be reviewing that code. The site should be self-contained with all node modules and code zipped up. See below for details:

For every card that is in the correct suited row, add one point
For every card that is in the correct column, add one point

Max points = 104

* ♠︎[A][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][T][J][Q][K]
* ♣︎[A][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][T][J][Q][K]
* ♥︎[A][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][T][J][Q][K]
* ♦︎[A][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][T][J][Q][K]

This configuration would give you 104 points = 100% correct order

MongoDB: use mongo as the persistent datastore to save the configurations and percentage, give it a sequence number also – use mongoose.js schema for the data access layer
Express.js: use express as the web server to handle routing the calls from the front end
Angular.js: use angular framework as the front-end templating engine
Node.js: use node to handle all the back-end business logic and database access
